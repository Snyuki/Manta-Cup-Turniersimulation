# Version 4 brings Performance!

#### New Features:
- Performance Buff
- Show Log
&nbsp;

#### Updates:
- Repositioned the "Summoner-Name"-Label and the "Elo"-Label on the Teamtabs
- Added Confirmation for stopping the Multi-Simulation
- Added Information-Window when Multi-Simulation ends
- Added the "Clear Log" option for both log-files via a Dropdown Menu
- Removed the logging of every single game when doing a Multi-Simulation with over nine Tournaments
&nbsp;

#### Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug where the third substitute wasn't taken into account when calculating the average elo of a team, which lead to a huge discrepancy between the calculated value and the actual value.
- Fixed a bug where the tables (both brackets and the Multi-Simulation update) were editable.
- Fixed a bug where the Playoff-Table was constantly updated in the background, which used a lot of unnecessary memory.
- Fixed a bug where the semifinalists were matched incorrectly against each other.

#### Performance Buff:
This Version is all about Performance. I'll make it short: The simulation of multiple tournaments in Version 4 is 50 to 100 times faster than it was in Version 3. You don't beleave me? Try it out! This will speed up the simulation of large numbers of tournaments a lot. Have fun testing the limits =).

#### Show Log:
You always thought that it was inconvienient that you have to open the log-file in your local explorer to find out the details about a tournament? Don't worry! Version 4 comes with a solution to this! You can now click on the "Show Log"-Button on the Simulation-Tab and select one of the available log-files. It will be opened in your Texteditor and you can just read through the log. Opening files can't be easier!
